# MongoDB Migration Summary

## Overview
The Mind Buddy backend has been successfully configured to run locally with MongoDB. The codebase was already using MongoDB with PyMongo, but was configured to use MongoDB Atlas. The changes made focus on enabling local MongoDB development.

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Configuration (`backend/.env`)
**Updated** the environment file to use local MongoDB:
- Changed `MONGO_URI` from MongoDB Atlas connection string to `mongodb://localhost:27017/mindbuddy`
- Added local CORS origins for development: `http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:8080`
- Set `LOGGING_LEVEL` to `DEBUG` for better development visibility
- Removed MySQL-related configuration variables (DB_URI, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME, DB_PORT)

### 2. Extensions Initialization (`backend/extensions.py`)
**Modified** to defer MongoDB client initialization:
- Changed `mongo = MongoClient()` to `mongo = None`
- Added comment explaining that MongoDB client is initialized in `__init__.py`
- This ensures proper initialization with the config from `.env` file

### 3. Documentation

#### Created `MONGODB_SETUP.md`
A comprehensive setup guide including:
- MongoDB installation instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Step-by-step setup process
- Troubleshooting section for common issues
- Database management commands
- Development notes about the data structure

#### Updated `README.md`
- Added reference to `MONGODB_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions
- Updated installation steps to reflect MongoDB usage
- Removed references to SQL migrations
- Added note that MongoDB collections are created automatically
- Updated access URLs to reflect Vite's default port (5173)

## Current Architecture

### Database Structure
The application uses MongoDB with 3 collections:

1. **users** - User accounts with authentication
   - Fields: email, password_hash, first_name, last_name, phone, created_at, updated_at, is_premium
   - Uses ObjectId for _id

2. **journal_entries** - User journal entries
   - Fields: user_id (ref), title, content, created_at, updated_at, is_private, sentiment, ai_insights, tags
   - Uses ObjectId for _id and user_id reference

3. **mood_entries** - Mood tracking data
   - Fields: user_id (ref), mood_level, emoji, note, triggers, created_at, updated_at
   - Uses ObjectId for _id and user_id reference

### Models
All models are implemented as Python classes with:
- Static methods for querying (find_by_id, find_by_email, find_by_user)
- Instance methods for CRUD operations (save, update, delete)
- Serialization methods (to_dict, from_dict)
- Direct MongoDB collection access via PyMongo

### Backend Stack
- **Framework**: Flask 3.1.2
- **Database Driver**: PyMongo 4.14.1
- **Authentication**: Flask-Bcrypt 1.0.1 + PyJWT 2.10.1
- **CORS**: Flask-CORS 6.0.1
- **Server**: Gunicorn 21.2.0 (production)

## Files Modified

1. `backend/.env` - Updated database connection and settings
2. `backend/extensions.py` - Modified MongoDB initialization
3. `README.md` - Updated setup instructions
4. `MONGODB_SETUP.md` - Created (new file)
5. `MONGODB_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Created (this file)

## Files NOT Modified (Already Compatible)

The following files were analyzed and found to be already compatible with MongoDB:

- `backend/config.py` - Already reads MONGO_URI from environment
- `backend/__init__.py` - Already initializes MongoDB correctly
- `backend/run.py` - No database-specific code
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Already has PyMongo
- `backend/models/user.py` - Already using MongoDB/PyMongo
- `backend/models/journal_entry.py` - Already using MongoDB/PyMongo
- `backend/models/mood_entry.py` - Already using MongoDB/PyMongo
- `backend/routes/auth.py` - Already compatible with MongoDB models
- `backend/routes/journal.py` - Already compatible with MongoDB models
- `backend/routes/mood.py` - Already compatible with MongoDB models
- `backend/routes/user.py` - Already compatible with MongoDB models

## How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
1. Install MongoDB Community Edition
2. Ensure MongoDB is running on port 27017
3. Install Python 3.10+ and Node.js 16+

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Install backend dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Start backend (MongoDB URI is already configured in .env)
python run.py

# 3. In another terminal, start frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

# 4. Access the app
# Frontend: http://localhost:5173
# Backend: http://localhost:5000
```

## Testing the Setup

### 1. Check MongoDB Connection
```bash
mongosh mongodb://localhost:27017
```

### 2. Test Backend Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

### 3. Test User Registration
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }'
```

### 4. View Data in MongoDB
```bash
mongosh mongodb://localhost:27017/mindbuddy
> db.users.find().pretty()
> db.journal_entries.find().pretty()
> db.mood_entries.find().pretty()
```

## Production Deployment

For production, update `backend/.env` (or set environment variables):
```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/mindbuddy?retryWrites=true&w=majority
CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-domain.vercel.app
LOGGING_LEVEL=INFO
```

## Additional Notes

- No data migration needed as the app was already using MongoDB
- All existing MongoDB Atlas data remains accessible by changing the MONGO_URI back
- Local development uses a separate database (`mindbuddy` on localhost)
- The app creates collections automatically on first use - no manual setup required
- ObjectId is used for all primary keys and foreign key references
- Timestamps are stored as ISO format strings for easy serialization

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check MongoDB is running: `mongosh` or check Services on Windows
2. Verify port 27017 is not blocked by firewall
3. Check backend logs for connection errors
4. Ensure `.env` file exists in `backend/` directory
5. Refer to `MONGODB_SETUP.md` for detailed troubleshooting

## Next Steps

1. Install MongoDB locally (see MONGODB_SETUP.md)
2. Run the backend with `python run.py`
3. Run the frontend with `npm run dev`
4. Create a test user account
5. Test journal and mood tracking features
6. Verify data persistence in MongoDB

The backend is now fully configured for local MongoDB development!
