# Frontend React Keys Addition Documentation

This document summarizes the changes made to add unique keys to `.map()` elements in various React components to resolve React warnings about missing keys.

## Changes Made

### ProgressDashboard.tsx
- **mockMoodData map**: Added key `mood-${mood.date}-${mood.mood}`
- **periods map**: Added key `period-${period}`
- **streaks map**: Added key `streak-${streak.type}-${index}`
- **goals map**: Added key `goal-${goal.id}`
- **achievements map**: Added key `achievement-${achievement.title}-${index}`

### PremiumFeatures.tsx
- **pricingPlans map**: Added key `pricing-plan-${plan.id}-${index}`
- **premiumFeatures map**: Added key `premium-feature-${feature.title}-${index}`

### PaymentModal.tsx
- **paymentMethods map**: Added key `payment-method-${method.id}`
- **supported map (within paymentMethods)**: Added key `support-${method.id}-${support}`

### Meditation.tsx
- **meditationSessions map**: Added key `meditation-session-${session.id}`
- **instructions map (within selectedSession)**: Added key `instruction-${selectedSession.id}-${index}`

### MentalHealthLayout.tsx
- **navItems map (mobile navigation)**: Added key `mobile-nav-${item.id}`
- **navItems map (desktop navigation)**: Added key `desktop-nav-${item.id}`

## Notes
- MoodTracker.tsx was verified to already have proper keys and required no changes.
- All keys are designed to be unique and descriptive, combining relevant identifiers (IDs, titles, indices) to prevent React reconciliation issues.
- These changes ensure React can efficiently track and update list items, improving performance and eliminating console warnings.

## Remaining Tasks
The following components still need key additions:
- Journal.tsx: filteredEntries and tags maps
- CrisisSupport.tsx: copingStrategies and crisisResources maps
- ThemeToggle.tsx: themeOptions map
- chart.tsx: payload maps
- toaster.tsx: toasts map
