### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) (if you want to run with MySQL locally)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Sereni-Crew/mind-buddy.git
    cd mind-buddy
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend (Flask):**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the backend directory
    cd backend

    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Create a .env file from the example and add your variables
    # For MySQL, you will need to install an additional driver:
    # pip install mysqlclient
    #
    # Your DATABASE_URL in the .env file should look like this:
    # DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:password@host/db_name"
    cp .env.example .env

    # Run database migrations
    flask db upgrade

    # Start the backend server (usually on http://127.0.0.1:5000)
    flask run
    ```

3.  **Set up the Frontend (React/etc.):**
    ```sh
    # Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory
    cd frontend

    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Create a .env.local file from the example and add your variables
    # The main variable you'll need is for the backend API URL:
    #
    # VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000
    cp .env.example .env.local

    # Start the frontend development server (usually on http://localhost:3000)
    npm run dev
    ```
